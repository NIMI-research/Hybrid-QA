It is the seat of Salt Lake County, the most populous county in Utah. With a population of 200,133 in 2020, it is the 117th most populous city in the United States, the city is the core of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, which had a population of 1,257,936 at the 2020 census. Salt Lake City is further situated within a larger metropolis known as the Salt Lake City\u2013Ogden\u2013Provo Combined Statistical Area, a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along a 120-mile (190 km) segment of the Wasatch Front, comprising a population of 2,746,164 (as of 2021 estimates), making it the 22nd largest in the nation. It is also the central core of the larger of only two major urban areas located within the Great Basin (the other being Reno, Nevada).\nSalt Lake City was founded on July 24, 1847 by early pioneer settlers led by Brigham Young who were seeking to escape persecution they had experienced while living farther east. The Mormon pioneers, as they would come to be known, entered a semi-arid valley and immediately began planning and building an extensive irrigation network which could feed the population and foster future growth. Salt Lake City's street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan, with the southeast corner of Temple Square (the area containing the Salt Lake Temple in downtown Salt Lake City) serving as the origin of the Salt Lake meridian. Owing to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the city was originally named Great Salt Lake City. In 1868, the word \"Great\" was dropped from the city's name.\nImmigration of international members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), mining booms, and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad initially brought economic growth, and the city was nicknamed \"The Crossroads of the West\". It was traversed by the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, in 1913. Two major cross-country freeways, I-15 and I-80, now intersect in the city. The city also has a belt route, I-215.\nSalt Lake City has developed a strong tourist industry based primarily on skiing, outdoor recreation, and religious tourism. It hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and is a candidate city for the 2030 Winter Olympics. It is known for its politically liberal culture, which stands in contrast with the rest of the state's highly conservative leanings. It is home to a significant LGBT community and hosts the annual Utah Pride Festival. It is the industrial banking center of the United States. Salt Lake City and the surrounding area are also the location of several institutions of higher education including the state's flagship research school, the University of Utah. Sustained drought in Utah has more recently strained Salt Lake City's water security and caused the Great Salt Lake level to drop to record low levels, and has impacted the local and state economy.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia page for Salt Lake City does not provide information about its time zone.

        "intermediate_logs": "Who is the mayor of Berlin?\n\nThought: Need to search for this information using Wikipedia Search\n\nAction: WikiSearch\n\nAction Input: mayor of Berlin\n\nObservation:Page: Governing Mayor of Berlin\nSummary: The Governing Mayor (German: Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister) of Berlin is the head of government, presiding over the Berlin Senate. As Berlin is an independent city as well as one of the constituent States of Germany (Bundesl\u00e4nder), the office is the equivalent of the Ministers President of the other German states, except the states of Hamburg and Bremen, where the heads of government are called \"First Mayor\" and \"President of the Senate and Mayor\", respectively. The title Governing Mayor of Berlin is the equivalent of Lord Mayor in the meaning of an actual executive leader.\n\nAccording to the Berlin Constitution, the Governing Mayor is member and head of the Berlin Senate. The ministers are called senators. The two deputies additionally hold the title of Mayor (German: B\u00fcrgermeister, historically: burgomaster). The title Mayor is also held by the heads of the twelve boroughs of Berlin, although they do not actually preside over self-governmental municipalities.\n\nThe Governing Mayor is elected by the city's state parliament, the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin (equivalent to the Landtag of other federal states), which also controls their policy guidelines and is able to enforce resignation by a motion of no confidence. The Governing Mayor is entitled to appoint and release the senators of the government.\n\nThe seat of the Senate is the city hall, Rotes Rathaus, in Mitte.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia article on the Governing Mayor of Berlin does not provide information about the current mayor of Berlin. I need to rephrase the keyword for the Wikipedia search.\n\nAction: WikiSearch\n\nAction Input: current mayor of Berlin\n\nObservation:Page: Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin\nSummary: Berlin is both a city and one of Germany's federated states (city state). Since the 2001 administrative reform, it has been made up of twelve districts (German: Bezirke, pronounced [b\u0259\u02c8ts\u026a\u0281k\u0259]), each with its own administrative body. However, unlike the municipalities and counties of other German states, the Berlin districts are not territorial corporations of public law (Gebietsk\u00f6rperschaften) with autonomous competencies and property, but simple administrative agencies of Berlin's state and city government, the City of Berlin forming a single municipality (Einheitsgemeinde) since the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. Thus they cannot be equated to US or UK boroughs in the traditional meaning of the term.\nEach district possesses a district representatives' assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung) directly elected by proportional representation and an administrative body called district board (Bezirksamt). The district board, comprising since October 2021 six (until then five) members - a district mayor (Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister) as head and five (earlier four) district councillors (Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te) - is elected by the district representatives' assembly, proportionally reflecting its party composition according to popular vote. The district board is in charge of most local administrative matters directly relevant to local citizens; however, all of its decisions can at any moment be revoked by the Berlin Senate. Furthermore, the districts are financially completely dependent on state donations, as they neither possess any taxation power nor own any property. The district mayors form a council of mayors (Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister, led by the city's governing mayor), which advises the Senate.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia articles on the Governing Mayor of Berlin and the boroughs of Berlin do not provide information about the current mayor of Berlin.
