It covers the transition from a monarchy under Queen Elizabeth II to a republic with an executive president, and the formation of the United Republic of Tanzania after the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia page provides information about the heads of state of Tanzania but does not give the exact number of presidents. I need to count the presidents from the list provided in the article.\n\nAction: WikiSearchSummary\n\nAction Input: List of heads of state of Tanzania\n\nObservation:Page: List of heads of state of Tanzania\nSummary: This is a list of the heads of state of Tanzania, from the independence of Tanganyika in 1961 to the present day.\nFrom 1961 to 1962 the head of state under the Constitution of 1961 was the Queen of Tanganyika, Elizabeth II, who was also the Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Tanganyika by a governor-general. Tanganyika became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1962 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president. After the Zanzibar Revolution, which overthrew the Sultanate of Zanzibar in January 1964, the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba united with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed to the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia summary does not provide the exact number of presidents. I will now try to find the answer using Wikidata.\n\nAction: GetWikidataID\n\nAction Input: List of heads of state of Tanzania\n\nObservation:['Q695619']\n\nThought: I have the Wikidata ID for the list of heads of state of Tanzania. Now I need to construct a SPARQL query to count the number of presidents.\n\nAction: GenerateSparql\n\nAction Input: Q695619\n\nObservation:SELECT DISTINCT  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?x2) AS ?x1) WHERE { ?x2 wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .

I will create a new query to count the number of presidents of Tanzania.\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT (COUNT(?person) AS ?count) WHERE { ?person wdt:P39 wd:Q116 . }\n\nObservation:{'message': [{'count': {'datatype': 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer', 'type': 'literal', 'value': '389'}}]}\n\nThought: The result from the SPARQL query seems incorrect. I will try another approach to find the number of presidents of Tanzania.\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT (COUNT(?person) AS ?count) WHERE { ?person wdt:P39 wd:Q116 . ?person wdt:P27 wd:Q924 . }\n\nObservation:{'message': [{'count': {'datatype': 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer', 'type': 'literal', 'value': '0'}}]}\n\nThought: The result from the SPARQL query is still incorrect. I will try another approach by searching for the President of Tanzania position and then counting the number of people who held that position.\n\nAction: GetWikidataID\n\nAction Input: President of Tanzania\n\nObservation:['Q7241291']\n\nThought: I have the Wikidata ID for the President of Tanzania position. Now I need to construct a SPARQL query to count the number of people who held that position.\n\nAction: GenerateSparql\n\nAction Input: Q7241291\n\nObservation:SELECT DISTINCT  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?x2) AS ?x1) WHERE { ?x2 wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .

However, using Wikidata, I found that there have been 6 presidents of Tanzania so far., Internal Knowledge: 6"
