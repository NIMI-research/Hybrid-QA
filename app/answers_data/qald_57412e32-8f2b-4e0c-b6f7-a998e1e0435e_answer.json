It covers the transition from a monarchy under Queen Elizabeth II to a republic with an executive president, and the formation of the United Republic of Tanzania after the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia article provides information about the heads of state of Tanzania, but it does not give the exact number of presidents. I need to check the list of presidents in the article.\n\nAction: WikiSearchSummary\n\nAction Input: List of heads of state of Tanzania\n\nObservation:Page: List of heads of state of Tanzania\nSummary: This is a list of the heads of state of Tanzania, from the independence of Tanganyika in 1961 to the present day.\nFrom 1961 to 1962 the head of state under the Constitution of 1961 was the Queen of Tanganyika, Elizabeth II, who was also the Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Tanganyika by a governor-general. Tanganyika became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1962 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president. After the Zanzibar Revolution, which overthrew the Sultanate of Zanzibar in January 1964, the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba united with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed to the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia summary does not provide the exact number of presidents Tanzania has had so far. I will now try to find this information using Wikidata.\n\nAction: GetWikidataID\n\nAction Input: Tanzania\n\nObservation:['Q924']\n\nThought: I have the Wikidata ID for Tanzania.

Now I need to execute the query on Wikidata.\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT DISTINCT  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?x2) AS ?x1) WHERE { ?x2 wdt:P31 wd:Q5 . wd:Q924 p:P6 ?x3 . ?x3 ps:P6 ?x2 . }\n\nObservation:{'message': [{'value': '1'}]}\n\nThought: The SPARQL query result indicates that there has been only 1 president of Tanzania, which seems incorrect. I will try a different approach to find the number of presidents using Wikidata.\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT DISTINCT ?x1 WHERE { wd:Q924 wdt:P6 ?x1 . }\n\nObservation:{'message': [{'value': 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16193885'}]}\n\nThought: The SPARQL query result still indicates that there has been only 1 president of Tanzania, which seems incorrect.
