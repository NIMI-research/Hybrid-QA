The former was a colony and part of German East Africa from the 1880s to 1919\u2019s when, under the League of Nations, it became a British mandate. It served as a British military outpost during World War II, providing financial help, munitions, and soldiers. In 1947, Tanganyika became a United Nations Trust Territory under British administration, a status it kept until its independence in 1961. The island of Zanzibar thrived as a trading hub, successively controlled by the Portuguese, the Sultanate of Oman, and then as a British protectorate by the end of the nineteenth century.\nJulius Nyerere, independence leader and \"baba wa taifa\" (father of the nation) for Tanganyika, ruled the country for decades, while Abeid Amaan Karume, governed Zanzibar as its president and Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania. Following Nyerere's retirement in 1985, various political and economic reforms began. He was succeeded in office by President Ali Hassan Mwinyi.\n\nThought: I now know the final answer based on both Wikipedia and Wikidata. \nFinal Answer: I am unable to find the exact number of presidents of Tanzania using both Wikipedia and Wikidata. However, I can provide some information about the history of Tanzania and its presidents. The modern-day African Great Lakes state of Tanzania dates formally from 1964, when it was formed out of the union of the much larger mainland territory of Tanganyika and the coastal archipelago of Zanzibar. Julius Nyerere, independence leader and \"baba wa taifa\" (father of the nation) for Tanganyika, ruled the country for decades, while Abeid Amaan Karume, governed Zanzibar as its president and Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania.
