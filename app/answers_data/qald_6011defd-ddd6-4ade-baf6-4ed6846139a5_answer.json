It covers the transition from a monarchy under Queen Elizabeth II to a republic with an executive president, and the formation of the United Republic of Tanzania after the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia article provides information about the heads of state of Tanzania but does not give the exact number of presidents.

The monarch was represented in Tanganyika by a governor-general. Tanganyika became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1962 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president. After the Zanzibar Revolution, which overthrew the Sultanate of Zanzibar in January 1964, the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba united with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed to the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia summary does not provide the exact number of presidents.
