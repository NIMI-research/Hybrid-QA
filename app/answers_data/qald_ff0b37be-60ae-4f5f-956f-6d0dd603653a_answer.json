Some of the most notorious gangsters of this time include Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Bugs Moran, Dutch Schultz, and Johnny Torrio. These gangsters were involved in various criminal activities such as bootlegging, gambling, and racketeering.\n\nThought: The Wikipedia article provides a list of some of the most notorious gangsters from the prohibition era, including Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Bugs Moran, Dutch Schultz, and Johnny Torrio.

I will try to find the QID for the Prohibition era itself and use it to construct a SPARQL query.\n\nAction: GetWikidataID\n\nAction Input: Prohibition era\n\nObservation:['There is no QID for the given keyword, please retry with another relvant keyword for the QID from Wikidata pages.']\n\nThought: I couldn't find a QID for the \"Prohibition era\" keyword either.

Now, I will try to construct a SPARQL query to find gangsters from the prohibition era.\n\nAction: GenerateSparql\n\nAction Input: Q399999\n\nObservation:The possible reason is\n 1) The query is syntactically wrong\n\n\nThought: The query was not constructed. I will try to create a SPARQL query manually to find gangsters from the prohibition era using the QID for \"Prohibition in the United States\" (Q399999).\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT ?gangster ?gangsterLabel WHERE { ?gangster wdt:P31 wd:Q215380 . ?gangster wdt:P106 wd:Q30185 . ?gangster wdt:P1317 wd:Q399999 .

I will try another approach by searching for gangsters and then filtering the results based on the prohibition era.\n\nAction: RunSparql\n\nAction Input: SELECT ?gangster ?gangsterLabel WHERE { ?gangster wdt:P31 wd:Q215380 . ?gangster wdt:P106 wd:Q30185 . ?gangster wdt:P1317 ?time_period . ?time_period wdt:P580 ?start_date . ?time_period wdt:P582 ?end_date .
