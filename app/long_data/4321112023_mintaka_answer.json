        "question": "What is the atmosphere of the Moon composed of?\n",
        "internal_knowledge": "The atmosphere of the Moon is composed of mostly helium and traces of other gases such as neon, hydrogen, and argon.",
        "wikipedia_answer": "The atmosphere of the Moon is a very scant presence of gases surrounding the Moon. For most practical purposes, the Moon is considered to be surrounded by vacuum. The elevated presence of atomic and molecular particles in its vicinity compared to interplanetary medium, referred to as \"lunar atmosphere\" for scientific objectives, is negligible in comparison with the gaseous envelopes surrounding Earth and most planets of the Solar System. The pressure of this small mass is around 3\u00d710\u221215 atm (0.3 nPa), varying throughout the day, and in total mass less than 10 metric tonnes. Otherwise, the Moon is considered not to have an atmosphere because it cannot absorb measurable quantities of radiation, does not appear layered or self-circulating, and requires constant replenishment due to the high rate at which its gases get lost into space.",
